A Python Implementation of the Bayesian Network
============================================

This is a simple binary Bayesian Network implementation. I had a lot of trouble trying to store the data for the conditional probability. If anyone has a better storage method please let me know.

Currently this implementation supports:
* Creating a binary state bayesian network
* Likelyhood Weighting Sampling

Code is open source of course but please do not use it for University/College assignments.

Running the Couldy Likeliness
---------------------------------------------
- You need numpy and scipy installed as well as python2.7
- ./cloudy_likelihood.py &lt; sample_size &gt;
